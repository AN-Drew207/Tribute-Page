                The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared 
            universe centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel
            Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
            The franchise includes comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, 
            much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, 
            settings, cast, and characters.<br>

            The first MCU film is Iron Man (2008), which began the films of Phase One culminating in 
            the crossover film The Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded 
            with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded 
            with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in the franchise are collectively 
            known as "The Infinity Saga". The films of Phase Four will begin with Black Widow (2021).<br>

            Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 
            on ABC in 2013, followed by streaming television with Daredevil on Netflix in 2015 and Runaways
            on Hulu in 2017, and cable television with Cloak & Dagger on Freeform in 2018. Marvel Television 
            produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios themselves expanded 
            to streaming with Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. Soundtrack
            albums have been released for all the films and many of the television series, as well as compilation
            albums containing existing music heard in the films. The MCU includes tie-in comics published by Marvel
            Comics, while Marvel Studios has produced a series of direct-to-video short films, called Marvel One-Shots,
            and a viral marketing campaign for its films and the universe with the faux news program WHIH Newsfront. <br>

            The franchise has been commercially successful and has generally received a 
            positive critical response. It has inspired other film and television studios 
            with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared 
            universes. The MCU has been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe, 
            including attractions at various Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, an attraction at Discovery 
            Times Square, a Queensland Gallery of Modern Art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks 
            for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.
